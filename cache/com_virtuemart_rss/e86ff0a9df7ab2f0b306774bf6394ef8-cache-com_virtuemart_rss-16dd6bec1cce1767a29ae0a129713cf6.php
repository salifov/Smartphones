<p>Joomla 2.5.x is not anylonger supported by the Joomla project, but we know that a lot people still use joomla 2.5. with VirtueMart. As promised, we provide a fix <a href="http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/1036/Joomla2.5.28-20161214PATCH.zip">http://dev.virtuemart.net/attachments/download/1036/Joomla2.5.28-20161214PATCH.zip</a>&nbsp;(Direct link).</p>
<p>This patch is just the one for j2.5.28 of last year extended by the new files. Update your joomal 2.5.x at least to the last version j2.5.28.</p>
<p>It is normal that an unpatched j2.5.28 logs you out. The patch should be still applied.&nbsp;</p></div>";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:4:"link";s:86:"http://virtuemart.net/news/latest-news/477-release-of-3-0-18-connecting-the-loose-ends";s:5:"title";s:45:"Release of 3.0.18 - Connecting the loose ends";s:11:"description";s:4852:"<div><p>This new VirtueMart 3 Version is completing the vm3.0 series. There won't be any new vm3.0.x updates other than if we have a security issue. Some of our developers are still developing on Joomla 2.5 to ensure the backward compatibility. But from now on, any new version will be developed on the most recent Joomla or WordPress releases. We won't break the compatibility by purpose, but we just cannot test any longer for older versions.</p>
<p>We have got VirtueMart running on WordPress already in our laboratory. WordPress opens a new market for shops which do not need a complex CMS setup. The last big task is at the moment only the router, which must be adjusted to the WordPress links. The ACL is at the moment only roughly translated, but it will be possible to make it more fine grained later, so that we can simulate 80% of the Joomla rights within Wordpress. Transforming VirtueMart to a cms-less system forces us to use an own user table. So in future we will have real Virtuemart users, not being based on the old Joomla table. The basic trick is that we still use a light version of the Joomla libraries, so extension developers can easily write extensions compatible to Joomla and WordPress. We hope that we can extend this technique to integrate VM into more CMS systems like Drupal. We plan to publish a beta before Christmas.</p>
<p>Since it is the last of its series, we added some of the<a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail" target="_blank"> membership features</a> to the main version. So product variants work now also in the category browse view. Changing the ordering within a dropdown of a multivariant was quite painful. But we added a drag and drop for the children list, so it is very easy to adjust.</p>
<p>Here an incomplete list of the new features</p>
<h3>New Features for shopowners</h3>
<ul><li>Customfields of type S (String) and P (Property) can be used to automatically create a dropdown for search (like tags)</li>
<li>Added ajax for child variants in category browse view - MV (MultiVariant) and GC (GenericVariant)</li>
<li>Category view now has the same options for displaying additional VM content as were available in the virtuemart view (which is now deprecated)</li>
<li>Update of com_tcpdf to tcpdf version 6.2.12</li>
<li>Added drag and drop sorting of MultiVariants in product edit</li>
<li>Already loaded grouped products are not displayed twice on the same browse view</li>
<li>Product is now virtually added to the cart before the conditions are tested. So it works now also for weights and other conditions (not just price)</li>
<li>User dependent currency for invoice, mail, and order view</li>
<li>Currency can now use the "space character" in the display format</li>
<li>Payment and shipment methods can now be edited in different currencies</li>
<li>Changed addProductToRecent so that it always stores 10 product ids; can be adjust by hidden config max_recent_products</li>
<li>Added a template vmbeez3 derived from beez3</li>
<li>New VirtueMart/Joomla! 3 full installer</li>
<li>Paypal accepts multiple currencies</li>
<li>Amazon works now with the cart ajax and updated library</li>
<li>Avatax taxfreightcode added</li>
</ul><h3>New Features for developer and templater</h3>
<ul><li>shopfunctions::getLoginForm works now with a sublayout login, so it can be used in other views</li>
<li>Added trigger plgVmOnCheckoutCheckStock</li>
<li>Removed id tag from dropdowns to ensure that chosen can always generate a unique id</li>
<li>Quite a lot of JS enhancements, more robust and faster</li>
<li>Added function sendCurrForm, which simply fires the form if an input has the right class.</li>
<li>Plugins can now define in the constructor which values should be handled as convertables</li>
</ul><h2><span>Important for shops with overrides</span></h2>
<p>The new js for using ajax for reloading product content uses now always the same class. The class is "product-container". Just search for the div with "productdetails-view productdetails" and add "product-container". In case you want the ajax reload within a product modul, you need to adjust the overrides here also. Furthermore the layout login of the user view is now in the sublayout folder. Members who used the ajax for child variants within the browse view should change the layout back to default.</p>
<p>For a full list of all changes or more information how to adjust your overrides, please read here in our forum <a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=135402.0">http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=135402.0&nbsp;</a><a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=135402.0"></a></p>

<p>Vm3.0.14 is a clean update for any older vm version. We fixed some bugs and added&nbsp;some new features paid by the membership system&nbsp;<a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail">http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail</a><br>Highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Change order status of multiple selected orders in the order list using one simple click</li>
<li>Create links without Category Name and/or without product suffix</li>
<li>product parent id editing field in product edit, so products can be attached to patterns</li>
<li>Product multivariants&nbsp;can use a radiolist instead of dropdowns</li>
<li>PHP7 compatibilty</li>
</ul><p>This is a very mature release. The maintrunk is already working with the new VMF system which should help to write a bridge for Wordpress. The vm3.1 version is for developers and eager early adopters. For the moment it is the goal, that the whole core works with the new abstraction layer, to concentrate and bundle the bridgeable code.</p>
<p>You should always take&nbsp;a backup of your database. The tableupdater has been&nbsp;strongly enhanced and should handle tables with broken or missing primary fields (fields with auto_increment) a lot better.&nbsp;Note that whilst this has been tested on numerous deployments of VM it is still relatively new.</p>

<h4>Protect Your Site Now</h4>
<p>If you are a Joomla user, check your logs right away. Look for requests from&nbsp;<span>146.0.72.83</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>74.3.170.33</span>or&nbsp;<span>194.28.174.106</span>&nbsp;as they were the first IP addresses to start the exploitation. I also recommend searching your logs for &ldquo;<span>JDatabaseDriverMysqli</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span>O:</span>&rdquo; in the User Agent as it has been used in the exploits. If you find them, consider your Joomla site compromised and move to the remediation / incident response phase.</p>
<p>For securing your joomla 1.5/2.5 pages, just follow this link&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Security_hotfixes_for_Joomla_EOL_versions">https://docs.joomla.org/Security_hotfixes_for_Joomla_EOL_versions</a>. It is basically replacing one file.</p>

<p>We are proud to offer the direct link between online and offline sales with VirtueMart &amp; POS for Webshops.</p>
<p>Now there is a complete Point of Sale (POS) available for VirtueMart. When you have a physical store and a VirtueMart webshop you can sell goods with your Point of Sale without giving your sales staff access to the VirtueMart backend. All products / orders / calculation rules / customers will be synchronized into the POS.</p>
<p>The sales staff can check the VirtueMart weborders from the POS and take the goods from the store with the OrderPicker. After an order is picked it will change the order status in Virtuemart automatically into a pre-defined status like &ldquo;Ready for Shipment&rdquo;. When new goods arrive from the supplier you can add those to the (VirtueMart) stock just by scanning the product barcode in the Stockmanager.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Key Features</strong></p>
<ul><li>Direct sync with VirtueMart</li>
<li>Easy interface</li>
<li>Different logins</li>
<li>Use VM calculation rules and Shopper Groups</li>
<li>Add customer to an order</li>
<li>Use barcodes to add products to an order.</li>
<li>Customize the sync options with the Payment methods in the POS.</li>
<li>You can print receipts as well as invoices.</li>
<li>Orderpicker and Stockmanger included.</li>
